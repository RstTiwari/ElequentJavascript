//Encapsulation:seprating the  inner interface  from the implementation is called as Encapsulations;
// Methods  : Method are basically Predeifned Function which Perform the Task on given Value

let Rabbit = {}

// it's better way of Defining Methods and parameter

// we can use  call method for explicitly using this method
//console.log(speak.call(hungarryRabit , "Burpppppp"))

//prodtotype : prototypes are another object
//Prototypes are the mechanism by which objects in JavaScript inherit features from another object
